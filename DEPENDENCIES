  TerraLib GeoWeb Services (TWS) - Dependencies
  =============================================

If you want to build yourself TWS then you need to install some third-party libraries. Below is a list of third-party libraries dependencies and its versions.


1. Boost (Mandatory)
--------------------

TWS is built on top of Boost libraries. You will need to have them installed in order to build TWS. Make sure to have at least version 1.54.0 installed.

If you prefer to install from source, download it from: http://www.boost.org.

Note:
- When using TWS on a machine with a installed version of SciDB you probably already have it installed.

- If you have installed TerraLib you already have Boost and you don't need to install it again.


2. TerraLib (Mandatory)

TWS is built on top of TerraLib, a free and open source library for building GIS enabled applications. Make sure to have at least TerraLib version 5.1.0.

Bash script for building all dependencies on Linux Ubuntu 14.04
----------------------------------------------------------------

We have prepared a special bash script for this purpose on Linux Ubuntu 14.04. This script can be found in TWS source tree under https://github.com/e-sensing/tws/tree/master/install/install-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.sh.

Follow the steps below:
1. Install TerraLib and its 3rd-party libraries. See the notes on: http://www.dpi.inpe.br/terralib5/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:terralib50_build

2. Download the TWS third-party libraries package used by the development: http://www.dpi.inpe.br/esensing-devel/tws-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.tar.gz.

- Copy the script install-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.sh to the same folder you have downloaded the tws-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.tar.gz.

- Open the shell command line and call the script install-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.sh setting the target to install all the stuffs from these third-party libraries and tools:
  $ TWS_DEPENDENCIES_DIR="/home/user/mylibs" ./install-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.sh
