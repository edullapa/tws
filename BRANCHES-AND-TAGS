  TerraLib GeoWeb Services (TWS) - Codebase Branches
  ==================================================

This document explains the available branches and tags in TWS' codebase.
You should refer to this document before choosing the right version of TWS to build.

List of Branches
----------------

You can check all branches available (remotes and local) and see the current one (marked with "*"):
  $ git branch -a

The output of above command will be something like:
  * master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master

In the above output the "* master" means that the current branch is master.

We have the following branches:
* master:
  This is the branch where the development team is working to add new features to future versions of TWS. It may be instable although the codebase is subject to automatic tests (regression and unittests). We don't recommend to generate production versions of TWS from this branch. Use it for testing new features and get involved with TWS development.

* b-1.0.0-alpha:
  This will be the first branch in TWS' codebase for the generation 1.

To switch to one of the branches listed above, use the checkout command and create a local branch to track the remote branch. The syntax of "git checkout" is:
  $ git checkout -b <local_branch_name> <remote_branch_name without this part "remotes/">

In order to switch to branch 1.0.0-alpha you can use the following command:
  $ git checkout -b b-1.0.0-alpha origin/b-1.0.0-alpha


List of Tags
------------

Also there are tags which usually are originated from a release branch. For instance, tag t-1.0.0-alpha1 will be originated from branch b-1.0.0-alpha.

To check all tags available, use:
  $ git tag -l           (list all tag names)
  t-1.0.0-alpha1
  t-1.0.0-alpha2
  t-1.0.0-beta1
  t-1.0.0-rc1
  t-1.0.0
  ...

If you want to checkout a specific version given by a tag and create a local branch to work on you can use the following git command:
  $ git checkout -b <local_branch_tag_name> <one_of_tag_name_listed>

For instance, to checkout 1.0.0-alpha1 you can enter the following command:
  $ git checkout -b 1.0.0-alpha1  1.0.0-alpha1

Final Remarks
-------------

After choosing the right branch or tag to work on, follow the BUILD-INSTRUCTIONS file available on the codebase.
